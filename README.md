# Real-estate-price-prediction-model
This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting real estate prices using linear regression and k-fold cross-validation techniques. The project demonstrates my skills in data science and machine learning. 

Project Highlights
Data Collection and Exploration: The project begins with gathering real estate data of houses in Bangalore, including features such as location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and historical prices. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to gain insights and understand the relationships between different variables.
Feature Engineering: Various feature engineering techniques are implemented to prepare the data for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for optimal model performance.
Linear Regression Model: Linear regression, a widely used regression algorithm, is employed to build a predictive model. The algorithm leverages the relationships between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (real estate prices) to make accurate predictions.
k-fold Cross-Validation: To ensure the robustness and generalization of the model, k-fold cross-validation is implemented. The dataset is divided into k subsets (folds), and the model is trained and evaluated k times using different combinations of training and testing sets. This technique provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.
